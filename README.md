# custom-combobox
Is a jQuery plugin that replaces the html dropdown, as featured on ComicsInventory.com

An array or a collection of objects can be used to fill the dropdown. It also supports formating the data in the dropdown with a template. The plugin also has edge detection which keeps the dropdown from spilling over the edges of the window. Only 5k!
